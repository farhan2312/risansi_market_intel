// One row per active user, every metric the portal can attribute to a person.

// Shared by the adoption workbook (lib/risansi-adoption-report.ts) and the
// individual PDF (app/print/portal-usage). Both are answers to the same
// management question, so they read from one query: a workbook and a handout
// that disagree about how many visits somebody logged is worse than either one
// alone.
//
// Two things worth knowing before quoting these numbers:
//
//   * Active time is measured, not inferred. page_activity records seconds a
//     page was actually in focus, so an hour is an hour of use rather than a tab
//     left open over lunch.
//   * Admin and sysadmin numbers are not comparable with a rep's. They are doing
//     data administration — uploads, corrections, client master work — which is
//     why the comparisons below are drawn within a role rather than across all.
