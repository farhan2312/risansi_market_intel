// The Overall tab: everything the audit trail can say about how the portal is
// being used, in the order somebody running a sales team would ask it.
//
//   Are people using it?        adoption, sessions, the daily curve
//   When do they work?          hour × weekday, desktop against mobile
//   What do they use it for?    time by module
//   Who is doing the work?      per person, against the size of their book
//   What came out of it?        records created, and the funnel they form
//   What needs attention?       the accounts and people nothing is happening on
//
// Every figure honours the same filters, and every timestamp is read in IST.
// page_activity stores timestamptz and the server runs in UTC, so a visit logged
// at 9am in Lucknow would otherwise land in the 03:00 column of the heatmap and
// the working day would appear to start before dawn.
