// visit status), matching the clients-page convention so the removable pills
// read nicely. Names come from trusted DB rows and are single-quote-escaped
// before inlining.
//
// TWO PREDICATES, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. `clientAnd` assumes a
// clients alias `c`. `visitAnd` assumes a visits alias `v` and NOTHING ELSE —
// several visit queries on the page do not join clients at all, so every
// client-side condition on the visit side is written as
// `v.client_id IN (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE ...)` rather than as `c.<col>`.
//
// That is not tidiness. The zone and route filters used to push `c.tour_id IN
// (...)` onto the visit side, which threw "missing FROM-clause entry for table
// c" in the stats query — swallowed by that query's try/catch, so picking a zone
// silently zeroed the Visits and Completed tiles instead of filtering them.

 * the filter bar runs on.
 *
 * IDS, NOT NAMES. users.name has no unique constraint — email is the unique key —
 * so a name list silently matches a namesake, which for an exhibition means
 * showing a block against the wrong person.
 *
 * EVERY ROLE. getVisitFilterOptions restricts to rep/manager because those are
 * the people who make visits. An exhibition team has no such restriction: the
 * picker offers every active user and directors do get added. Scoping team
 * members through a rep/manager list drops them from everyone's calendar but
 * their own.
 *
 * AN EMPTY RESULT MEANS EMPTY. getScopedRepNames returns [] for "no filter",
 * "filter matched nobody" and "the query threw" alike, so a caller cannot tell
 * them apart; a zone filter matching no reps would widen the scope instead of
 * emptying it. Here the filters are conditions inside one query, so no match is
 * no rows.
 *
 * The viewer is always in the base set — a manager with nobody under them would
 * otherwise not see their own exhibitions — but they are subject to the filters
 * like anyone else, so filtering to another rep hides your own blocks rather
 * than leaving them stuck on screen.
