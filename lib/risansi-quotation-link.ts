// One reading of opportunities.quotation_link, shared by every screen and export
// that shows it.
//
// The column has accumulated four different meanings over the life of the app,
// and until now each screen guessed at them separately:
//
//   236  an in-app path, /api/risansi/opportunities/<id>/quotation — a real
//        uploaded PDF, the only shape the app still creates.
//   679  one or more external SharePoint urls, typed in before uploads existed.
//        39 of those hold TWO urls separated by blank lines, because someone
//        pasted a second quotation into the same box; 5 also carry a document
//        name alongside the url.
//    10  a document name with no url at all — 'For Panpat.pdf',
//        'Risansi_Spare_Quotation_SHRI MALAPRABHA SSK_Dt09-06-2026'. A record
//        that a quotation exists somewhere, not an address.
//   886  null.
//
// Two of those shapes were actively broken in the UI. A bare name went into
// href={...} unchanged, and a browser resolves that relative to the current
// page — so 'For Panpat.pdf' on /risansi/clients/393 navigated to
// /risansi/clients/For%20Panpat.pdf and 404'd. A two-url value went into href
// whole, blank lines and all, so the second quotation was unreachable and the
// first was wrapped in a url the browser had to guess at.
//
// Nothing here discards anything. The stored text is left exactly as it is and
// read more carefully instead, which is what turns those 39 second links back
// into something a rep can click.
