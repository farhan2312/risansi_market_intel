/**
 * Why this returns a failure instead of throwing one.
 *
 * Next.js redacts every error thrown out of a server action in production. The
 * browser receives "An unexpected response was received from the server" and the
 * real reason — the constraint, the column, the value — stays on the server where
 * nobody reading the screen can act on it. That is exactly how this upload came
 * to fail silently for weeks: the message existed, it just never left the box.
 *
 * A returned value is not redacted. So the action catches its own failure and
 * hands back what actually went wrong, along with the Postgres error code and
 * constraint name when there is one.
