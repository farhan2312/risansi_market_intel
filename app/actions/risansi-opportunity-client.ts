// The bulk quote and order-in-hand imports attached some opportunities to the
// wrong client — the code and name on the record agree with each other, they
// simply belong to somebody else. Nothing in the normal UI can fix that:
// client_id is set at creation and the edit form has no control for it, by
// design, because moving a deal between accounts changes who can see it.
//
// So this is sysadmin-only, and it is deliberately the whole job rather than a
// bare UPDATE: an order booked against the deal has to follow it, or revenue and
// pipeline start disagreeing for both accounts.
