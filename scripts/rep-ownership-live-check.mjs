// Phase 8: is the live rule sound enough to delete the rollback lever?
//
//   node scripts/rep-ownership-live-check.mjs
//
// Read-only. rep-ownership-diff.mjs answered a different question — old rule
// against new rule, in the abstract — and its "open work that would leave
// someone's view" section predates the in-flight limb that phase 5 added. That
// limb is why those records are still visible, so the diff overstates the loss.
//
// This asks the only question that matters now: running the predicate that is
// actually in production, is there an open record its owner cannot see?
