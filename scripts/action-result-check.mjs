// ── The other half: refusals that are still thrown ─────────────────────────
//
// An action that THROWS its refusal is worse than one that returns it badly,
// because the message never arrives at all: Next redacts a thrown
// server-action message in production, and the user is shown "An error
// occurred in the Server Components render". That has cost real time three
// times now — a client that would not save because its code belonged to an
// archived record, a meeting refused for a blank company name, a business
// card refused for its format. Each time somebody had written a careful
// sentence explaining exactly what to do, and the framework ate it.
//
// Thirty-six actions still do this. Converting them all at once is a larger
// change than it is worth today, so this is a ratchet rather than a wall: the
// known ones are listed and the build fails only when a NEW one appears.
// Fixing one and deleting its name is always welcome — the check says when a
// name no longer belongs on the list.
//
// Not every throw counts. An auth or lock guard that throws is fine: it is not
// telling somebody how to fix what they typed, and it reads the same in every
// action. What is caught is a thrown SENTENCE — eighteen characters or more —
// in an action that does not return a result.
